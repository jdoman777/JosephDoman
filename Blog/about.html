                    <h2 class="section-heading">Disclaimer</h2>      
                        <p>I'd like to make myself abundantly clear: This blog won't help you get to know me.</p>
                        <p>Don't get me wrong, though. Scanning a couple of these posts is going to help you get to know my creative process, my <i>unmatched</i> sense of humor (that typically makes my wife roll her eyes), and even my general interests and some of what I most care about.</p>
                        <p>But there is no way for you to glean, from just these posts and the tone of my writing, who I <i>really</i> am.</p>
                        <p>Because that is the case, this blog (and this section <i>of</i> this blog) is simply a springboard. This will never be an all-inclusive list of every little piece of who I am. But by golly it might just get you started.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Brief Bio</h2>
                        <p>So, after that unneccessarilly flowery intro, let's get to brass tacks. Who the heck am I? Since a lot of my "laundry list" interests will be showcased in my writing - or maybe just shine through anyways - I'll bypass those. Instead, I'll give a brief background of my life.</p>
                        <p>My name is Joseph Doman. I am from Kirksville, Missouri, a small midwestern college town that is stuffed with kind people and boredom. I lived in Mexico and San Diego for a quick 2-year stint doing service for my Church and getting to know incredible people and a fantastic language in the process. I moved to Provo, Utah for college at Brigham Young University after finishing that mission trip. </p>
                        <p>I dated and married my wife soon after that, which helped me realize what life is supposed to be. I assume I'll learn that lesson again once we have children. Anyways, I took some intro classes at BYU and found out Advertising is pretty cool, so I declared that my major. I've been thriving since.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading"><i>Why</i> do I do what I do?</h2>
                        <p>So now that I've covered the essentials, I'd like to shed a little bit of light on what guides and directs me in my life. Why do I do what I do? That's a complex question, but hopefully this list of my philosophies, general principles, and random quirks will help:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I require goals to function. I need goals to orient me and routines to drive me toward those goals</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>My faith makes me whole.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>My wife is my life.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>I've got sensitive ears. No, I don't mean I can't stand loud noises. Basically, if there's an audio input I can't control, I can't focus. It's probably because of my music background. Short version: AirPods with smooth jazz are a God-send.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>It is very difficult for me to do something at a low level if I <i>could</i> do it at a higher level. One of my former bosses told me that I needed to learn the lesson that if 80% effort suffices, then don't do more. Sounds like a super obvious lesson that most people are born knowing, but it's hard for me to let go of some things.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>I love people, (which is why I'm doing Advertising) but I've got a pretty strict social battery. You can visibly see it run out if I spend more than a couple hours at a social event with more than 5 people</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Ironically, at the same time, I am constantly cracking dumb jokes and making puns with anyone that gives me the light of day. If you have a huge meeting that you don't want to pay attention to, sit next to me.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>I'm a grammar freak. I cannot stand grammar errors and I am <i>this</i> close to a visible tick when people make them. It's even worse when it's mine, so if you find an error in my writing, message me immediately. Sometimes it's a styllistic choice: you've got to learn the rules to break 'em, right? But sometimes it is not, so PLEASE message me if you find an error.</li>
                            <br>
                        </ul>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">One Final Note</h2>
                        <p>This is an ongoing list, with incoming updates. Hopefully you've gotten a glimpse into my brain and learned a bit about who I am. I have one final note to share in this Synopsis section. This blog is exactly that: a blog. It is <i>not</i> all my best work. It is just a beautiful amalgamation of my thoughts, ideas, and experiences. So, don't critique too harshly. And don't be surprised by random updates! I will continuously modify and expand the content here. I hope you find at least something you enjoy.</p>
                        <p>So that's me... or at least a beginning of me. If you'd like to know the rest, send me a message.</p>
